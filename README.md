**do-mpc** is a comprehensive open-source toolbox for robust **model predictive control (MPC)**
and **moving horizon estimation (MHE)**.
**do-mpc** enables the efficient formulation and solution of control and estimation problems for nonlinear systems,
including tools to deal with uncertainty and time discretization.
The modular structure of **do-mpc** contains simulation, estimation and control components
that can be easily extended and combined to fit many different applications.

In summary, **do-mpc** offers the following features:

* nonlinear and economic model predictive control
* support for differential algebraic equations (DAE)
* time discretization with orthogonal collocation on finite elements
* robust multi-stage model predictive control
* moving horizon state and parameter estimation
* modular design that can be easily extended

The **do-mpc** software is Python based and works therefore on any OS with a Python 3.x distribution. **do-mpc** was originally developed by Sergio Lucia and Alexandru Tatulea at the DYN chair of the TU Dortmund lead by Sebastian Engell. The development is continued at the [Chair of Process Automation Systems](https://pas.bci.tu-dortmund.de) (PAS) of the TU Dortmund by Felix Brabender, Joshua Adamek, Felix Fiedler and Sergio Lucia.
